# vim-snipe

> Fast linewise motions and edits

### Why?

**1. Automate fixing typos on the same line.**

I make mistakes often enough to make this worth automating - in fact, I made a few mistakes while writing this line.

**2. No more `;` and `,` repetition when using linewise motions.**

I almost always know where I want to go, but I'm forced to navigate incrementally to that place.

**3. There aren't any plugins containing or focused on the same feature set.**

The two plugins with the most overlap in functionality are

* [Stupid-EasyMotion](https://github.com/joequery/Stupid-EasyMotion)
* [vim-easymotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion)

Stupid-Easymotion constrains motions to `line('.')`, but it only provides mappings for `f`, `w`, and `W`. It also
hasn't seen any activity in a long time - 4+ years at the time of this writing.

[vim-easymotion has a similarly incomplete API](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion/issues/354). It's also
[sprawling](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/1v9qyu/actively_developed_and_maintained_fork_of/ceq7lcf/), and (IMHO)
painful to extend.

However, I'd like to give credit to vim-easymotion, having borrowed some core functionality and logic:

* highlighting initialization
* clever algorithm for building the jump tree

### Installing

If you use a plugin manager this is as simple as

```vim
Plug 'yangmillstheory/vim-snipe'
```

The above example uses [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug); tweak accordingly for your plugin manager.

### Usage

Note that all motions below (except cutting, swapping, and replacing) work in character, visual and operator-pending modes.

#### Character motions

```vim
map <leader><leader>F <Plug>(snipe-F)
map <leader><leader>f <Plug>(snipe-f)
map <leader><leader>T <Plug>(snipe-T)
map <leader><leader>t <Plug>(snipe-t)
```

#### Word motions

```vim
map <leader><leader>w <Plug>(snipe-w)
map <leader><leader>W <Plug>(snipe-W)
map <leader><leader>e <Plug>(snipe-e)
map <leader><leader>E <Plug>(snipe-E)
map <leader><leader>b <Plug>(snipe-b)
map <leader><leader>B <Plug>(snipe-B)
map <leader><leader>ge <Plug>(snipe-ge)
map <leader><leader>gE <Plug>(snipe-gE)
```

#### Swap `xp`

```vim
nmap <leader><leader>] <Plug>(snipe-f-xp)
nmap <leader><leader>[ <Plug>(snipe-f-xp)
```

#### Cut `x`

```vim
nmap <leader><leader>x <Plug>(snipe-f-x)
nmap <leader><leader>X <Plug>(snipe-F-x)
```

#### Replace `r`


```vim
nmap <leader><leader>r <Plug>(snipe-f-r)
nmap <leader><leader>R <Plug>(snipe-F-r)
```

### FAQ

> Why did you constrain to `line('.')`?

There's no need to scan the whole buffer, given `set relativenumber`. Thus, this approach is more performant and IMHO more natural.

> But I've been getting by just fine without this!

Cool, then you shouldn't use it. I use it everyday, so it serves me well, and hopefully I'm not the only one.

### Contributing

Pull requests are welcome; no special process is required. Currently there's no optionality for the highlighting format, for example.

I'm sure there's also plenty of bugs which I won't have the time or inclination to always fix (try using the plugin when browsing Vim documentation, e.g.).
